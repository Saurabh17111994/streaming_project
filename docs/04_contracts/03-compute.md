# Segment Build Contract — Compute

## Boundary

The Signal Flink job consumes `raw_table_1`, performs bounded fingerprint deduplication, computes final 15-second event-time candles, and passes forming-bar state directly to Business Logic in the same job.

**Tier-scoped deployment (current testing phase):** the current phase builds and validates the Signal job on the approved 1,024-instrument / single-connection envelope (20,480 ticks/s at 20 Hz per instrument). The 3,000-instrument / 50,000 ticks/s variable baseline remains the deferred production target (`PERF-PROD-60000-001`; `PERF-PROD-90000-001` retired with the peak campaign, DEC-036); per-instrument windowing, dedup, and candle logic are identical across envelopes — only the load/acceptance profile differs.

## State (DEC-038 — authoritative → Fluss, transient/recovery → Flink)

The Signal job's state splits into three categories:

**Authoritative durable state — Fluss:** the fingerprint dedup set (a Fluss KV state table keyed `(instrument_token, fingerprint_version, event_fingerprint)` → `(first_seen, expiry)`, `bucket.key = instrument_token`), closed candles (`feature_candles_15s` KV), and current signal state (`Signal_Candidates_current` KV). Dedup has configured, bounded TTL covering the declared ingestion retry/replay horizon plus watermark delay; deployment rejects shorter or unbounded values. Durable state survives a Flink restart independently of a large Flink checkpoint.

**Transient execution state — Flink working state:** per-instrument event-time window accumulator, the `candle-emitted` window flag, the signal-detection ring buffers, and a bounded in-process dedup working cache so the hot path performs no Fluss round trip per tick.

**Recovery state — Flink checkpoint:** source offsets, watermarks, event-time timers, and minimal execution metadata. The checkpoint is intentionally small and is not a second complete copy of Fluss-owned business state.

Production checkpoints/savepoints use encrypted S3. The exact state backend and connector versions are pinned and tested.

**Restart contract:** restore the compact Flink checkpoint → verify Fluss authoritative-state availability and compatibility → rehydrate only the working state actually needed → resume. Fluss unavailability/incompatibility fails the job closed (no silent replay); deterministic continuation and safe degradation are preserved.

## Event-time and finalization

The deployed watermark, allowed-lateness, and source-idleness values are configuration parameters, not universal protocol constants. The default profile is bounded out-of-orderness of five seconds, allowed lateness of five seconds, and source idleness of fifteen seconds. Each value may be changed only through a tested deployment profile. A source without a verified event timestamp cannot advance the watermark.

A candle is final from its first write: the final row emits at first window fire (watermark ≥ `window_end`), an `emitted` window-state flag makes any allowed-lateness re-trigger a no-op (late-within-lateness folds into the accumulator and is counted, never re-written), and no correction/update row exists in MVP. The "final after `window_end + allowed_lateness`" phrasing means the finalization boundary — the candle is not corrected after that point. The finalization contract SHALL separately name the watermark out-of-orderness bound, source-partition idleness threshold, allowed/finalization delay, source split identity, reconnect/reassignment behavior, and late-event classification. The term `allowed lateness` SHALL not imply correction/update rows.

## Deduplication horizon

The `dedup_horizon` is the maximum supported append retry, connector replay/rewind, checkpoint restore rewind, broker replay, and approved operational replay interval, plus a documented safety margin. `DEDUP_TTL_MS` SHALL be exactly `300000` (5 minutes) in MVP; deployment SHALL reject any other value. The implementation SHALL report accepted event rate, dedup entries, serialized entry bytes, physical backend/checkpoint bytes, and restore duration at the variable 50,000 ticks/s average baseline. (The 90,000 ticks/s peak is retired, DEC-036.)

## Typed handoff to Business Logic

Compute SHALL expose both typed closed-candle events and typed forming-bar events to Business Logic within the Signal job. Each event includes instrument, `portfolio_id` or routing scope when applicable, window boundaries, source schema/configuration versions, deterministic ordering metadata, and event/processing timestamps. Business Logic SHALL not reconstruct these events by reading the candle table back.

## Outputs

- `feature_candles_15s` immutable final rows
- Typed in-job forming-bar events to Business Logic
- Invalid, duplicate, late, watermark, checkpoint, and backpressure metrics

`Trade_Decisions` are immutable instruction records published by the Signal job; Compute and Ranking do not expose a Fluss round trip between forming-bar updates and Business Logic evaluation.

## Guarantees

Exactly-once applies only to the pinned integration-tested Flink state/sink boundary. It does not imply cross-table atomic visibility or broker-call exactly-once.

**State-boundary acceptance:** (1) large durable Signal state is observable in Fluss; (2) the Flink checkpoint remains bounded and does not duplicate the full durable state; (3) restart restores compact Flink state and rehydrates from Fluss without full raw-history replay; (4) Fluss state unavailability or incompatibility causes safe degradation; (5) checkpoint failures remain safe.

## Acceptance

Out-of-order, duplicate, identical-legitimate-event, empty/invalid window, late discard, deterministic replay, checkpoint restore, backpressure, node/process restart, and workload-envelope tests pass.
