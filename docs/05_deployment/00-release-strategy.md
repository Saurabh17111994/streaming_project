# Release Strategy

## Status and authority

This document defines the deployment and release strategy for MVP Phase 4.2. It is derived from the active project decisions, requirements, architecture, and build contracts:

- `../01_project/06-delivery-scope.md`
- `../02_requirements/00-index.md`
- `../02_requirements/06-operational.md`
- `../03_architecture/platform-architecture.md`
- `../04_contracts/00-index.md`

The platform is **blocked for live-money release** until the evidence-gated protocol, exact-version, schema, safety, capacity, recovery, security, and observability gates pass. Paper or simulated trading does not waive those gates.

## Environment policy

| Environment | Orchestrator | Purpose | Order placement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local/development | Docker Compose | Fast development and component integration | Disabled by default; simulation only unless explicitly approved |
| Integration/acceptance | Docker Compose or production-like test harness | Deterministic contract, fault, workload, and recovery tests | Simulated/sandbox only |
| Production | Four-VM Docker Swarm | Three workload/HA VMs plus one observability VM | Disabled until all live-money gates pass |

Compose is not proof of production HA. Production placement, replication, checkpoint recovery, security, and failure tolerance must be tested on the Swarm topology.

## MVP release scope

MVP Phase 4.2 includes:

- Evidence-approved Arrow market-data ingestion with original packet preservation
- `raw_table_1` and reconciled Fluss schemas
- Bounded best-effort fingerprint deduplication
- Event-time 15-second OHLCV candles and final-on-emission behavior
- Forming-bar Business Logic and immutable candidate audit
- In-operator Ranking and immutable ranking audit
- Portfolio reservation gates and immutable `Trade_Decisions`
- Durable Executor gate, attempts, mappings, reconciliation, fencing, and Arrow REST handoff
- Independent postback capture, `Fills`, `Order_Lifecycle`, and fill-derived `Positions`
- Checkpointed Babysitter job that emits zero actions
- Operational logs, metrics, health, alerts, and durable execution audit
- Verified EOD Iceberg/S3 offload with retention safety buffer
- Local Compose and production four-VM Swarm definitions

Deferred capabilities include real Babysitter actions, advanced features, market-context ranking, multi-broker support, BSE/currency derivatives, Kubernetes, automatic live gap backfill, ML ranking, backtesting, and business analytics.

## Release stages

### Stage 0 — Evidence and version freeze

Before implementation is accepted:

1. Approve Arrow packet/postback artifacts or captured sandbox corpus.
2. Prove required broker identities, status values, timestamps, reference echo, limits, and response behavior.
3. Pin immutable versions/digests for Flink, Fluss, Java, Python, connectors, broker protocol/SDK, Arrow REST, OpenObserve, and project images.
4. Record the version matrix and compatibility classification.

Unknown external behavior remains a blocker and is never filled with a plausible value.

### Stage 1 — Local contract validation

Use Compose to validate:

- Reconciled DDL/schema parity
- Golden packet decoding and raw-byte preservation
- Ingestion, Flink, Action Capture, Executor, and Babysitter interfaces
- Identity and ownership rules
- Duplicate, out-of-order, malformed, partial-write, restart, and quarantine behavior
- Safe-halt and two-person resume in simulation

### Stage 2 — Production-like acceptance

Use the four-VM Swarm topology to validate:

- variable 50,000 ticks/s average baseline (3,000 instruments; ≈16.7 ticks/s/instrument average) for a full session
- One workload VM loss at the per-instrument production rate
- p50/p95/p99 SLO reporting with exact workload/version context
- One workload VM loss at the normal baseline
- S3 checkpoint/savepoint recovery
- Fluss replication/quorum and bounded backlog
- EOD manifest verification and retention protection
- Security, observability, and audit reconstruction

### Stage 3 — Controlled production enablement

Production begins with:

1. Gate `HALTED`.
2. Reconciled broker orders, fills, positions, attempts, and reservations.
3. Verified changelog continuity and checkpoint health.
4. Verified observability and alert ownership.
5. Two distinct authenticated operators approving the same gate epoch/evidence hash.
6. A documented rollback and halt procedure available to operators.

Automatic enablement and automatic resume are prohibited.

## Release gates

Live-money deployment requires all of the following:

- Critical risks closed with evidence
- Exact protocol/version matrix approved
- DDL, requirements, contracts, tests, and architecture consistent
- Crash-window tests produce no duplicate broker order
- Unknown outcomes halt within five seconds and cannot retry automatically
- Restart with unverifiable Executor state defaults to `HALTED`
- Fencing prevents concurrent active Executors
- variable 50,000 ticks/s average-baseline workload tests passes (90,000 ticks/s peak retired, DEC-036)
- One-workload-VM failure posture is proven
- Data recovery target under 30 seconds is met for accepted scenarios
- EOD offload and three-day retention safety are proven
- Seven-year encrypted audit retrieval is proven
- Security, secret rotation, least privilege, and unauthorized-control tests pass
- Dashboards, alerts, runbooks, rollback, and gate approval evidence are operational

## Change-control rule

Every deployment-affecting change records:

- Requirements/contracts/DDL/interfaces affected
- Version and schema compatibility classification
- State and savepoint impact
- Gate/halt requirement
- Prechecks and acceptance tests
- Rollback criteria and recovery path
- Post-deployment verification

Schema-breaking clean-break migration is allowed only before live-money release and requires destructive-change approval plus reset/replay evidence.

## Local development commands

The following are illustrative local workflow commands; exact scripts are implementation-owned and must be verified against the repository:

```bash
make env
make up
make ddl
make logs
make down
```

`make clean` or volume deletion is destructive and must not be used against production data.
