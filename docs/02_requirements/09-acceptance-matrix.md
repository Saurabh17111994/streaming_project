# 09 — Acceptance Traceability Matrix

## Purpose

This matrix maps every requirement ID to at least one binary acceptance test. Each row cross-references the owning requirement file for detailed criteria. Individual requirement files retain their prose acceptance sections; this matrix provides the centralized implementation checklist.

An evidence-gated requirement (marked `EVIDENCE-BLOCKED`) remains blocked until the exact external behavior and version are proven in the specified test.

## Coverage model

| Coverage type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Full** | The acceptance test verifies every SHALL statement in the requirement. |
| **Partial** | The test verifies some SHALL statements; uncovered criteria are listed. |
| **Indirect** | The requirement is validated through a parent/cross-domain test. |

Every SHALL statement in every requirement MUST have a specific test or evidence record. A requirement with Partial or Indirect coverage MUST list the uncovered criteria so the gap is explicit.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | No test exists |
| `EVIDENCE_BLOCKED` | External/runtime facts unproven |
| `FAILED` | Test exists but does not pass |
| `PASSED` | Test passes under declared conditions |
| `SKIPPED` | Deferred with explicit approval |

## Traceability rule

When a requirement changes, the corresponding row SHALL be reconciled. No acceptance ID may be removed without deprecation evidence. New requirements SHALL add rows to this matrix before being marked implementation-ready.

Partial or Indirect coverage rows SHALL list the uncovered criteria explicitly. Every SHALL statement in every requirement MUST resolve to a specific test or evidence record. A requirement that is fully covered by another domain's test (e.g., a storage requirement validated by an executor test) SHALL use `Indirect` coverage and reference the exact covering acceptance ID.
