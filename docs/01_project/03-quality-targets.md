# Quality Targets and Delivery Guarantees

## Performance SLOs

Every SLO must report p50, p95, and p99, the workload profile, UTC clock source, sample duration, and whether failures/restarts are included.

| Stage | Target | Measurement boundary |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Decode to raw append acknowledgement | < 50 ms target | Broker event received → `raw_table_1` acknowledgement (includes ≤ 20 ms transport linger) |
| Trigger tick to winner commit | **p99 < 100 ms** (single release target) | Signal-triggering tick consumed by Flink → `Trade_Decisions` commit at 60,000 ticks/s (3,000 instruments) |
| Winner commit to Executor receipt | Baseline required | Instruction commit → Executor changelog receipt; set release threshold from the pinned connector benchmark |
| Broker REST call | Baseline required | Arrow REST request start → verified broker response; separate from stream SLO and evidence-gated |
| Data-path recovery | < 30 s target | Failure detection → ingestion and Flink processing resumed |
| Safe-halt | < 5 s target | Uncertain-state detection → order gate blocks new submissions |
| EOD offload | < 30 min target | Market close → verified Iceberg commit and manifest |

The 15-second event-time candle wait is a business/windowing characteristic, not hidden latency. Report it separately as `window_end → candle publication` and `trigger_tick → winner_commit`.

Every latency report MUST include p50, p95, p99, UTC clock source, test duration, instrument count (3,000), the declared workload profile and observed total tick rate, failure/restart inclusion, exact software versions, and VM specification. Internal diagnostic timestamps (source receipt, raw visibility, Signal-job consumption, candidate/ranking evaluation, winner commit) are recorded for diagnosis but are not independent release gates — the single 100 ms p99 trigger-to-commit target applies to the 60,000 ticks/s baseline profile.

## Workload envelope

The active instrument manifest is fixed at **3,000 instruments** for a trading session (runtime manifest changes require a controlled restart). Market-data arrival is variable: an instrument may receive fewer than 20 ticks/s, and no instrument may exceed **30 ticks/s**. The expected baseline is an average of **20 ticks/s per instrument** over the declared measurement window, or **60,000 ticks/s** across the manifest. The capacity peak is **90,000 ticks/s** (3,000 × 30). Arrival spacing is not fixed and a 50 ms per-instrument schedule is prohibited as a production claim.

Final machine sizing (CPU, RAM, disk I/O, network bandwidth) is evidence-gated by `PERF-PROD-60000-001` and the one-workload-VM-loss test. Current deployment allocations (500 GB SSD per VM) are a starting point, not a proven sizing result.

| Scenario | Tick rate | Duration | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Variable baseline | 60,000 ticks/s average (3,000 instruments; average 20 ticks/s/instrument) | 30-minute production-manifest test | Required latency release gate |
| Capacity peak | 90,000 ticks/s (3,000 instruments; each instrument ≤30 ticks/s) | Declared peak campaign | Bounded backlog, memory, checkpoint, recovery, and no acknowledged loss |

Tests must use the full 3,000-instrument production manifest. Synthetic workloads must preserve variable per-instrument arrivals, maintain the declared average/cap, and record the generator seed/profile. The p99 <100 ms release target applies at the baseline; the peak campaign proves safety and boundedness rather than inventing a second latency threshold.

The platform must meet the production latency SLO at the 60,000 ticks/s baseline and must verify bounded backlog, backpressure, checkpoint stability, recovery, and absence of acknowledged data loss at the 90,000 ticks/s peak.

### Production-workload evidence record

| ID | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PERF-PROD-60000-001` | Daily declared-duration run at 3,000 instruments and 60,000 ticks/s with complete resource/checkpoint/latency report | `DEFERRED`; not a live-money blocker for the current testing phase. The current phase validates the 1,024-instrument / single-connection configuration. |
| `PERF-PROD-90000-001` | Declared-duration peak run at 3,000 instruments and 90,000 ticks/s with every instrument capped at 30 ticks/s | `DEFERRED`; not a live-money blocker for the current testing phase. The current phase validates the 1,024-instrument / single-connection configuration. |

## Delivery guarantees

| Boundary | Guarantee |
| --- | --- |
| Broker WebSocket → ingestion | At-least-once; broker-provided sequence is not assumed |
| Ingestion → Fluss LOG | At-least-once with client retry behavior |
| Tick deduplication | Bounded best-effort using an event fingerprint; not proof of exact identity when Arrow supplies no sequence/event ID |
| Flink managed state and Fluss sinks | Exactly-once only where the pinned Flink/Fluss integration tests prove the specific checkpointed boundary |
| Fluss command → Executor | At-least-once changelog delivery; Executor deduplicates by `instruction_id` / attempt identity |
| Executor → broker REST | At-least-once command submission unless broker idempotency/reconciliation proves effectively-once behavior |
| Fill capture | At-least-once postback processing with idempotent state updates and immutable audit events |

A broker REST call is never described as exactly-once merely because the producing Flink job is checkpointed.

### Broker connection recovery

Broker connection recovery MAY take up to **five minutes**. This objective does not override per-instrument freshness safety: an affected instrument is halted as soon as it becomes `STALE` or `UNKNOWN`, regardless of the reconnection objective. A disconnected broker does not permit trading on stale data — the affected instruments halt immediately when their freshness rule fails, and the remaining healthy instruments continue trading.

## Order-gate safe-halt

The Executor owns the final gate before every new-order or position-changing broker call.

### Broker REST response timeout

An Arrow REST request without a verified response after **15 seconds** SHALL become an `UNKNOWN` outcome. The Executor SHALL immediately: persist the attempt as `UNKNOWN`, write an immutable `Execution_Audit` event, halt all new orders globally, and initiate reconciliation before any retry or resume. The complete timeline is: request starts → 15-second timeout → detection → gate block (≤5 seconds from detection) → reconciliation.

### Gate state machine

```text
HALTED
  → RECONCILING(evidence_hash, epoch)
  → APPROVAL_PENDING(first_approver)
  → ENABLED(second_distinct_approver)
  → HALTED(reason, detected_at, next_epoch)
```

The gate enters `HALTED` for duplicate-order risk, unknown submission outcome, checkpoint failure affecting the order path, stale signal state, missing fill correlation, or failed changelog continuity. A restart with unverifiable gate state defaults to `HALTED`.

### Automatic restart recovery

Data-path services (Ingestion, Flink jobs) MAY recover automatically within **5 minutes**, subject to their own readiness checks.

Executor auto-resume after a restart is permitted **only** when durable evidence proves ALL of the following:

1. Known gate state and epoch (not corrupted or missing)
2. One valid fencing owner with durable epoch/token
3. No `UNKNOWN` attempts (all attempts are in a terminal resolved state)
4. No unresolved order correlations (every `client_order_ref` has a verified `broker_order_id` mapping)
5. Healthy changelog continuity (no gaps, valid consumer position)
6. Healthy Signal-job/checkpoint evidence (recent successful checkpoint, no state corruption)
7. Fresh mandatory health signals (Signal job, Action Capture, Ingestion all report healthy)

If ANY proof is missing, the Executor remains `HALTED`. Reconciliation and the existing approved-resume path apply. Executor auto-resume SHALL produce an immutable audit event and OpenObserve notification including the evidence hash and every check performed. Do not leave conflicting active text that "every restart requires two-person approval" alongside this conditional rule — auto-resume is permitted only with complete proof; without it, the two-person approval path applies.

Resumption requires:

1. Broker order reconciliation
2. Open position and fill reconciliation
3. Changelog offset / consumer-health verification
4. Confirmation that the signal job and checkpoints are healthy
5. Resolution of every unknown attempt and reservation
6. Two distinct authenticated operators approving the same gate epoch and evidence hash

Existing positions may be monitored during a halt, but no new order is submitted until the gate returns to `ENABLED`.

## Per-instrument freshness

A data-quality problem (stale data, broker disconnect, or unknown instrument state) halts decisions and orders for affected instruments only — it does not halt unrelated healthy instruments.

### Freshness states

Every instrument SHALL have a versioned `instrument_freshness` state with at minimum:

| State | Meaning | Effect on orders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FRESH` | Recent verified data received within the configured threshold | Eligible for decisions |
| `STALE` | No recent verified data within the configured threshold | Blocked for decisions and orders |
| `UNKNOWN` | Cannot determine freshness (source unavailable, unverifiable) | Blocked for decisions and orders |
| `MARKET_CLOSED` | Exchange session is closed | Blocked for decisions and orders |

A `STALE` or `UNKNOWN` instrument blocks new decisions and new orders for that instrument only. Unrelated healthy instruments remain eligible. The exact freshness signal type and threshold are evidence-gated (`EVIDENCE-GATE-FRESHNESS-001`) because some instruments may legitimately be quiet; no numeric threshold is assigned until proven by broker-message freshness, trade-tick freshness, quote freshness, and exchange/session behaviour evidence.

### Automatic recovery

An instrument transitions from `STALE` or `UNKNOWN` back to `FRESH` automatically only after fresh data remains stable for the configured evidence-backed recovery period. A new session begins each trading day. Recovery evidence SHALL be auditable.

### Scoped halt path

A scoped, auditable safety-halt request SHALL flow from the data-quality owner to the Executor for affected instruments. The Executor gate's global halt (for unknown broker outcomes, checkpoint failures, etc.) remains a separate, independently enforced safety layer.
