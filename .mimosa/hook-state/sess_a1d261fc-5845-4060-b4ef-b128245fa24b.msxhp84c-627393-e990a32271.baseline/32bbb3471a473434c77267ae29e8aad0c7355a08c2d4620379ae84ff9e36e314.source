"""evidence_ownership_check.py — CI gate for the non-root ownership contract.

Every evidence record the ddl-apply CONTAINER writes must be GROUP-WRITABLE and
owned by the engine user's group: the entrypoint wrapper claims the evidence
root for the non-root engine user (uid/gid DDL_APPLY_UID/GID, default 10001)
with setgid 2775 + umask 002, so records land 664 (gid == the engine group) and
host automation in the shared group can read AND manage them. This gate fails
on any violation of that contract:

  EVIDENCE ROOT DIR (scoped like records — enforced only when the corpus is
  container-owned):
    * owner == root (0)        -> FAIL (the wrapper's ownership repair never
                                   ran; the container ran as root)
    * owner == engine uid but the dir lacks setgid or group-write (expected
      2775)                   -> FAIL (descendants would not inherit the group)

  RECORDS (apply.json):
    * owner == root (0)        -> FAIL (the container ran as root)
    * owner == engine uid but group != engine GID  -> FAIL (host automation in
      the shared group could not manage the record)
    * owner == engine uid but NOT group-writable   -> FAIL (umask/setgid repair
      regressed)

Records owned by any OTHER uid (host-side `make ddl` runs, which write with the
host user's own umask) are OUT OF SCOPE — that path is not governed by the
container non-root contract. Detection is by owner uid (the definitive
container-written marker).

Run:  python3 code/01_platform/04_scripts/evidence_ownership_check.py
Wired into: make docs-audit (C15), make evidence-ownership-check, the Monday
verification gate's DDL step, and the ddl-apply image (`evidence-check`
subcommand + auto-run at the end of every `apply`).
