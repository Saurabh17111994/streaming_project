/**
 * Writer/column ownership matrix for Execution_Attempts
 * ({@code code/01_platform/02_sql/ddl/12_execution_attempts.sql} v2, SCH-15).
 *
 * <p>Executor is the sole table owner (contract docs/04_contracts/07-executor.md;
 * {@link com.trading.common.ownership.OwnershipMatrix} row "order
 * gate/attempt/mapping/audit"), but two sub-modules update disjoint column
 * groups of the same row, which is exactly where {@code partial_update}
 * column ownership is load-bearing:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code attempt-store} owns the transition state — {@code phase} /
 *       {@code phase_epoch} (monotonic, R-234), {@code prepared_ts},
 *       {@code retry_attempt}. It mints the PREPARED attempt and applies every
 *       legal phase transition (incrementing {@code phase_epoch} by exactly 1).</li>
 *   <li>{@code broker-adapter} owns the call-evidence group —
 *       {@code broker_order_id}, {@code outcome}/{@code outcome_detail},
 *       {@code submitted_ts}/{@code terminal_ts},
 *       {@code broker_response_summary}. Reconciliation (UNKNOWN resolution)
 *       writes through this same group under the stale-version guard, never
 *       through the transition-state group.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Identity columns — the PK {@code execution_attempt_id}, account /
 * instruction / partition scope, {@code request_hash} + {@code client_order_ref}
 * (deterministic attempt identity), {@code gate_epoch} (stored at creation),
 * and {@code schema_version} — are written once at PREPARED and never
 * partial-updated.
