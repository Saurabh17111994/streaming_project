"""LogScan.py — scan Fluss log segments for truncated (unclean-shutdown) tails.

An unclean tablet shutdown can leave a segment file preallocated/zeroed past
the last complete batch. Fluss's own reader misparses the zeroed batch header
as valid and jumps through the garbage region, so the recovery error position
is NOT the true boundary (observed: reported 670,347,188 while the real
boundary was 670,345,400). This scanner walks the batches with the same
arithmetic the server uses and reports the exact end of the last complete
batch.

Batch layout (Fluss 0.9, verified against DefaultLogRecordBatch):
    48-byte header; batch total size = 12 + int32_le(header[8:12])
    (little-endian, confirmed against a known batch: bytes 24 09 00 00 = 2340).
A header of all zero bytes is the preallocated tail marker.

Usage:
    python3 LogScan.py <segment.log> [segment.log ...]

Prints per file: size, last-complete-batch end, delta, and (when truncated)
    TRUNCATE_TO=<end>
Exit 0 always (the caller decides); callers parse TRUNCATE_TO lines.
