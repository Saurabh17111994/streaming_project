"""Stale table-kind scanner for the 2026-08-13 table-kind re-scope.

Default mode — docs/08_implementation dossiers: detects claims that
contradict the re-scope and reports the hits that are NOT already annotated
as historical/superseded:

  * feature_candles_15s described as a LOG       -> it is the KV upsert table
                                                    (PK (instrument_token, window_start))
  * Signal_Candidates described as a KV table    -> it is the append-only LOG;
                                                    Signal_Candidates_current is the KV
  * feature_candles_15s_current mentioned at all -> the table is deleted (DDL 22 removed)

Phase-status claims (same annotation tiers, narrower marker set — e.g. a bare
"2026-08-13" or "RE-SCOPED" annotates table-kind history but NOT a stale
status claim):

  * forming-bar-postponed         -> forming bar described as postponed/pending/
                                     upcoming (the handoff + KV persistence landed
                                     2026-08-16; only the full Business Logic
                                     internals remain pending)
  * ranking-reservation-postponed -> ranking/reservation described as postponed
                                     (Slice 3 was REMOVED from scope by CHG-005,
                                     2026-08-15 — not deferred)
  * trade-decisions-active        -> Trade_Decisions output described as
                                     produced/emitted/streamed (it is gated off:
                                     TRADE_DECISIONS_ENABLED=false, no producer
                                     in scope)

Numeric-drift claims (same annotation tiers):

  * tables-count-stale     -> a table count of 20-23 (the manifest and
                              DdlBootstrap.ALL_TABLES now carry 24 tables)
  * acceptance-count-stale -> "151 acceptance IDs" (the acceptance matrix
                              carries 152 unique rows)

Counts equal to the current truth (24 tables, 152 acceptance) never match;
only stale values are reported. A date or historical marker within
NUMERIC_WINDOW chars of the count token annotates the claim as "the count at
that time" (e.g. "(2026-08-10: ... 21 tables ...)") — a distant date on the
same line does NOT hide a stale code description.

Test-count drift claims (same tiers, truth from the docs-audit C6 line,
01-foundation.md L3 — TEST_COUNT_TRUTH below, currently 466/247/387):

  * test-count-stale -> "common N" / "ingestion N" / "compute N" (or
                        "N common/ingestion/compute tests") claims where N
                        differs from the C6 truth. The correct values
                        (TEST_COUNT_TRUTH) are filtered in code.
  * c6-triple-stale   -> "docs-audit C6 line N/N/N" citations where any of
                        the three counts (common/ingestion/compute) differs
                        from the C6 truth.

Annotation classification (per hit):
  UNANNOTATED        no historical marker anywhere near the claim — the line
                     reads as current design (these are the findings to review)
  SECTION-ANNOTATED  the enclosing # heading, or a supersession banner
                     blockquote in the same H2 section, declares the content
                     historical/re-scoped
  LINE-ANNOTATED     the claim span itself (or the whole line, for deleted-table
                     mentions) carries a marker
  DOC-ANNOTATED      the whole document is banner-declared a historical record

Heuristic rules that keep this precise:
  * markers are only trusted within a short claim span (table name .. kind
    token), so an unrelated marker elsewhere on the line cannot hide a claim;
  * a "kind-change" marker (was LOG, R-084, converted, re-scoped, back to LOG)
    within KIND_WINDOW characters of the table name annotates the claim;
  * for mentions of the deleted feature_candles_15s_current, any marker on the
    same line is trusted (nearly every such mention is contextualized);
  * supersession banner blockquotes are scoped to their H2 section and must
    declare content superseded (not merely scoping which rows are historical).

`--upstream` mode — adds the authoritative upstream layers to the scan
(docs/01_project, docs/02_requirements, docs/03_architecture,
docs/04_contracts, docs/05_deployment) alongside the dossiers; `--dir` accepts
several directories. change-records/ subdirectories are never scanned — they
are immutable point-in-time records whose counts ("rollback to 21 tables")
are historical by construction. Claims are the same table-kind, phase-status,
and numeric-drift patterns everywhere.

Exit status: 0 when no stale hits (markdown) / no drift (--ddl); 1 when
findings exist (usable as a gate, e.g. `make stale-tables`).
