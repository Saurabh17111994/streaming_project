"""09 Production Swarm — offline static validation of docker-stack.yml.

These are OFFLINE checks (no swarm, no VMs, no docker daemon required). They
verify the production stack compiles to a legal, deployable Swarm manifest:

  * every service has a pinned `image:` (Swarm has no build step),
  * every service has a `deploy:` block (replicas/placement/restart),
  * workload placement is by node LABEL (`node.labels.role == worker`), never
    a hostname — this is what makes the same stack v1 (Manager+Worker) → v2
    (Manager-ONLY) without a rewrite (081820 DECISION v1→v2),
  * no Compose-only / Swarm-ignored keys (`build`, `depends_on`,
    `container_name`, `ports`, `network_mode`, top-level `restart:`),
  * networks are encrypted overlays (SN/w08),
  * secrets are `external: true` Swarm secrets,
  * per-node durable volumes are declared.

Live quorum/HA behaviour (SWARM-MGR-001..006) is NOT testable offline — that
is M3 (multi-VM rig). These tests only gate M2 (offline prep → 1-host mimic).
