/**
 * ING-E2E-001: full-stack fake-broker → bridge → IngestionService → Fluss.
 *
 * <p>Requires a fake HFT broker URL (provided by a fixture script that starts
 * the Go fake broker) and a live Fluss at localhost:9123. The Java service is
 * launched as a subprocess with ARROW_HFT_URL pointing at the fake broker, the
 * built bridge binary as ARROW_BRIDGE_BIN, and the normal env. The test asserts
 * the service starts, the bridge connects, ticks flow, the bridge survives a
 * forced disconnect by reconnecting in-process (a second ACTIVE
 * subscription_ack), and the service's final bridge-loop report shows the tick
 * count grew after the reconnect — i.e. appends resumed on the fresh epoch.
 *
 * <p>Set {@code INGESTION_INT_TEST_E2E=true} (the fake broker is started by
 * this test itself — the historical {@code FAKE_HFT_URL} env var is unused).
 *
 * <p><b>Harness hardening (2026-08-15):</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code LOG_DIR} is pointed at a writable JUnit temp dir — the
 *       log4j2 {@code JSON_FILE} appender defaults to
 *       {@code /data/ingestion/logs}, and when that path cannot be created the
 *       root logger's events are dropped, leaving the assertions blind to the
 *       service's startup logs.</li>
 *   <li>Startup/disconnect markers are <b>polled</b> (250 ms interval, bounded
 *       deadlines) instead of a fixed 8 s sleep, so a slow JVM/clock-check no
 *       longer fails a healthy run and a fast run finishes as soon as the
 *       evidence appears.</li>
 *   <li>Cluster pre-flight (2026-08-15): before launching the service the test
 *       verifies the dev Fluss stack serves data — TCP 9123 (coordinator) and
 *       TCP 9124 (tablet) must accept. The tablet only binds after every log
 *       segment recovers, so a missing tablet listener with a crash-looping
 *       container means truncated segments from an unclean shutdown; the
 *       failure message points at the surgical repair
 *       ({@code code/01_platform/04_scripts/fluss-repair/repair-tablet.sh},
 *       runbook section in 11-testing-and-release.md). Without this, the test
 *       burned the full 90 s startup window polling for {@code Fluss
 *       connected} and failed with a confusing stderr tail.</li>
 *   <li>Append-success proof (CHG-014): {@code ARROW_TICK_COUNTS=1} makes the
 *       bridge report its cumulative emitted-tick total every second
 *       ({@code arrow-tick-counts: total=N}, drained and re-logged by the
 *       service). After the forced disconnect the test polls for a <b>second</b>
 *       {@code subscription_ack state=ACTIVE} (the reconnect), then waits for
 *       the bridge's reported total to grow past the pre-reconnect baseline,
 *       then asserts the service's final {@code bridge loop ended (ticks=B, …)}
 *       report exceeds that baseline with zero errors — the reconnect epoch
 *       demonstrably appended ticks to Fluss.</li>
 *   <li><b>File-based stderr capture (root cause fix, CHG-014):</b> the
 *       service's stderr/stdout are redirected to files and the poll loop
 *       reads the files. The original pipe-based reader was killed by
 *       {@code Process.destroy()}: on this JDK (17.0.19) {@code destroy()}
 *       closes the parent-side process input streams with
 *       {@code IOException("Stream closed")} while the child is still running
 *       its shutdown hooks (verified with a slow-exit probe), so every console
 *       line the service wrote during the graceful shutdown — including the
 *       final {@code bridge loop ended} report — entered a pipe with no reader
 *       and was discarded. The file appender (own fd) always had the full
 *       shutdown, which is why the JSON log was complete while the buffer
 *       froze. Files survive {@code destroy()}, so the final report is now
 *       reliably captured.</li>
 *   <li>No-orphan guard (CHG-016): after the service exits, the test asserts
 *       the bridge pid (parsed from {@code arrow-bridge started (pid=N)},
 *       last match) is no longer alive — the shutdown hook's final reaping
 *       sweep must have taken it down — and the fake broker is force-reaped
 *       and asserted dead, so nothing the service or the test spawned
 *       survives.</li>
 * </ul>
