 * Supervisor health snapshot (NDJSON record_type {@code "bridge_metrics"}).
 *
 * <p>Additive v2 extension of the bridge NDJSON contract: the Go supervisor
 * emits one line every 10s with the values it is authoritative for — the
 * largest per-slot consecutive-reconnect streak, the number of live HFT
 * sockets (orphaned streams stay visible because the Go side counts
 * open/close, not lifecycle events), and the bridge process goroutine count.
 * Ingestion maps these onto the process-level gauges
 * {@code bridge.reconnect_consecutive}, {@code bridge.active_sockets} and
 * {@code bridge.go_goroutines}.
