//! Bridge client layer.
//!
//! The bridge is the single Arrow-facing component. This module mirrors the Go bridge's private
//! wire protocol (`code/02_services/06_execution_bridge/go-bridge/models.go`) in `protocol`, and
//! provides a `BridgeClient` seam with a deterministic in-process fake bridge for offline testing.
