//! Crash-exactly-once composite proof — plan Task B2
//! (docs/plans/2026-08-25-live-readiness-unified-plan.md, Phase B).
//!
//! The unit suite in `src/executiongate.rs` covers each crash hook individually. This
//! integration test walks the FULL plan checklist in one scenario against shared durable
//! stores and a cumulative bridge counter — the properties that must hold across a real
//! `kill -9` between "intent accepted durably" and "bridge ack recorded":
//!
//! 1. The bridge sees the order EXACTLY ONCE across crash + restart (mid-flight crash:
//!    broker got it, our process died before recording).
//! 2. Exactly ONE durable attempt record exists for the instruction after recovery.
//! 3. Recovery from the ambiguous window HALTS the partition (`UnknownHalted`).
//! 4. The operator re-enable bumps the gate epoch; the PRE-CRASH command (old epoch +
//!    fence) is then rejected `Blocked` with no new bridge call.
//! 5. A fresh command under the new epoch/fence succeeds exactly once with its own
//!    broker id; the durable store converges to one record per attempt.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test --offline --test crash_exactly_once`
