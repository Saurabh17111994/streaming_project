 * Deterministic manifest-derived slot assignment for safety suppression

 *
 * <p>The tracker consults this to (a) resolve which slot owns a token and
 * (b) verify that an incoming safety request's {@code assigned_token_set_hash}
 * matches the hash of the tokens deterministically assigned to that slot.
 * A request whose hash disagrees with the manifest-derived assignment is not
 * trusted (its slot could have been claimed by a different manifest).
 *
 * <p>Serializable: the assignment is a value object carried as a field of the
 * safety-halt consumer's Flink operator, so it crosses the job-graph
 * serialization boundary (Item E live run, 2026-08-18).
