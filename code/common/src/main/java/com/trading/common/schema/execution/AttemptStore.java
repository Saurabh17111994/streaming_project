/**
 * Attempt lifecycle store (docs/08_implementation/05-execution-core.md &rarr;
 * "Attempt rules"): mints exactly one PREPARED attempt per
 * (instruction_id, request_hash), refuses to rewrite an attempt's identity,
 * and applies only legal phase transitions with a monotonic {@code phase_epoch}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code prepare} contract, per the dossier:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a new (instruction_id, request_hash) mints one PREPARED attempt
 *       ({@link AttemptRecord#prepared});</li>
 *   <li>a duplicate (instruction_id, request_hash) returns the existing attempt
 *       without creating a second record and without touching its identity;</li>
 *   <li>a modified decision under an existing instruction_id (same id, different
 *       request_hash) is a contract violation: the store requests a halt through
 *       its callback and does not mutate anything.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The transition contract, per the dossier:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>legal transitions are PREPARED &rarr; SUBMITTING; SUBMITTING &rarr;
 *       ACCEPTED / REJECTED / CANCELLED / UNKNOWN; UNKNOWN &rarr;
 *       ACCEPTED / REJECTED / CANCELLED — the UNKNOWN exits only through
 *       {@link #resolveUnknown} (explicit reconciliation result), never via
 *       {@link #transition} (blocks new submissions and auto-retry);</li>
 *   <li>every accepted transition increments {@code phase_epoch} by exactly 1;</li>
 *   <li>a stale {@code phase_epoch} update (expected != current) is rejected
 *       without mutation;</li>
 *   <li>terminal phases (ACCEPTED / REJECTED / CANCELLED) cannot transition
 *       again.</li>
 * </ul>
