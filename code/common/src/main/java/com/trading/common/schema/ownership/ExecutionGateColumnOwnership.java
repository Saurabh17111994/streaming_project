/**
 * Writer/column ownership matrix for Execution_Gate
 * ({@code code/01_platform/02_sql/ddl/11_execution_gate.sql} v3, SCH-15).
 *
 * <p>Executor is the sole table owner (contract docs/04_contracts/07-executor.md),
 * but three sub-modules update disjoint column groups of the same row
 * ({@code partial_update} column ownership is load-bearing here):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code gate-transition} owns the gate lifecycle — {@code state},
 *       {@code epoch} (incremented by exactly 1 on every accepted transition),
 *       {@code reason} / {@code detection_time} / {@code evidence_hash} /
 *       {@code transition_ts} recorded with each state change.</li>
 *   <li>{@code gate-fence} owns the partition lease — {@code owner_instance_id},
 *       {@code fence_token} (monotonic sequence, never reused),
 *       {@code fence_acquired_ts}, {@code lease_expires_ts},
 *       {@code fence_lost_ts}. The fence group is written only by the fenced
 *       leader under the deployment leadership mechanism (ASM-EXE-005 /
 *       REQ-EXE-012); a stale owner/sequence is rejected before every command.</li>
 *   <li>{@code gate-approvals} owns the two-person approval group —
 *       {@code approval_1} / {@code approval_2} (authenticated, distinct,
 *       authorized principals) and {@code approved_evidence_hash} (the exact
 *       evidence hash both approvals covered, so an epoch change invalidates
 *       the approvals).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Identity columns — the PK {@code execution_partition_id},
 * {@code account_scope_id} (account-safe routing, R-233) and
 * {@code schema_version} — are written at row creation and never
 * partial-updated.
